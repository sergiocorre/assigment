# Introduction

Engineering time is expensive. That's why companies are willing to invest in a product that comes with clear and to-the-point documentation. It's like a shortcut to speed up work.

Following Google's style guide, the best documentation often comes in the form of good sample code. Even if the explanations are crystal clear, developers still prefer solid code examples. Code and plain text are like different languages, and developers value code the most.

Trying to explain code with just words is like trying to explain a Spanish poem in English.

With this in mind, the strategy is to keep code samples short and sweet. However, as we'll see later, these decisions need to fit the context and specific discussions with collaborators, like developers and project managers.

Although it's tempting to keep code examples brief, leaving out parameter names can confuse beginners and affect product quality, user engagement, and customer acquisition. Keeping a product and marketing perspective is essential.

For instance, where should code descriptions go â€“ inside the code or in separate text? When readers copy code snippets, they get comments too. So, it seems better to have descriptions within code comments. But, for complex explanations, it's usually clearer to place the text before the code.

The first thing to clarify with developers is the complexity and whether a sample needs prerequisites before running, like installing libraries or adjusting IDE dependencies. Considering the user's expertise level is also important.

Now let's see how these ideas play out in actual documentation.
